Simple, small, experimental free app to boost your speaker/headphone volume.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Setting the volume too high really can destroy speakers or earphones, or damage hearing.  IF YOU HEAR DISTORTED AUDIO, LOWER THE VOLUME (but it may be too late).

By installing this application you agree that you will not hold its developer responsible for any damage to hardware or hearing, and you are using it AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Consider this to be EXPERIMENTAL software.

On the Kindle Fire, you can make Speaker Boost show up on top of an app by tapping the left side of the status bar, and choosing "Speaker Boost".
